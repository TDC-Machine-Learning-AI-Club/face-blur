# FACE BLUR APPLICATION
Python code to apply blur effect on faces from images and videos.
Can be used in making content where subjects do not want to be recognized or identified.

### How it works
Faces are detected from images using _dlib face recognition_ library, then the detected coordinates are used as the _region of interest (roi)_ to apply gaussian blur using opencv.

### How to install dlib face_recognition libraries
On Linux/MacOS just install them directly using PIP
