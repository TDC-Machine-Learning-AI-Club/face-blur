Python code to apply blur effect on faces from images and videos.
Can be used in making content where subjects do not want to be recognized or identified.

### How it works
Faces are detected from images using _dlib face recognition_ library, then the detected coordinates are used as the _region of interest (roi)_ to apply gaussian blur using opencv.

### How to install dlib face_recognition libraries
On Linux/MacOS just install them directly using PIP
